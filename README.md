# Medical-Diagnosis
Medical Diagnosis System 

This repository contains a project that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning to diagnose medical conditions and suggest prescriptions based on patient-reported symptoms. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and it uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to process text data and make predictions.

Features :

1-Text Preprocessing: Tokenization and padding of patient-reported symptoms.

2-Label Encoding: Encoding of disease and prescription labels.

3-Model Architecture: A neural network model with an embedding layer, LSTM layer, and dense layers for disease and prescription predictions.

4-Training: The model is trained to predict both disease and prescription from the input symptoms.

5-Prediction: Function to make predictions based on new patient-reported symptoms.
